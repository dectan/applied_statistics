<p>This repository is used for the project given during the Applied Statistic module on Higher Diploma in Data Analytics course from ATU.</p>

<p>I have created Jupyter Notebook in Visual Studio Code, & I have added added comments to explain work, along with references<br>

# Introduction #

<p>This repository is used for the project given during the FUNDAMENTALS-OF-DATA-ANALYSIS module on Higher Diploma in Data Analytics course from ATU.</p>

<p>For this module I created two notebooks.</p>

<p>
<li>tasks.ipynb, which contains all the work relating to tasks section</li>
<li>project.ipynb, which contains all the work relating to project section</li>
</p>
<p> The tasks section scope is as follows
<ol>
<li> *Task 1* : Permutations and Combinations
Suppose we alter the Lady Tasting Tea experiment to involve twelve cups of tea. Six have the milk in first and the other six having tea in first. A person claims they have the special power of being able to tell whether the tea or the milk went into a cup first upon tasting it. You agree to accept their claim if they can tell which of the six cups in your experiment had the milk in first.

Calculate, using Python, the probability that they select the correct six cups. Here you should assume that they have no special powers in figuring it out, that they are just guessing. Remember to show and justify your workings in code and MarkDown cells.

Suppose, now, you are willing to accept one error. Once they select the six cups they think had the milk in first, you will give them the benefit of the doubt should they have selected at least five of the correct cups. Calculate the probability, assuming they have no special powers, that the person makes at most one error.

<li> *Task 2* : numpy's Normal Distribution
In this task you will assess whether numpy.random.normal() properly generates normal values. To begin, generate a sample of one hundred thousand values using the function with mean 10.0 and standard deviation 3.0.

Use the scipy.stats.shapiro() function to test whether your sample came from a normal distribution. Explain the results and output.

Plot a histogram of your values and plot the corresponding normal distribution probability density function on top of it. </li>

<li> Clone repository </li> 
<li> Open repository in Visual Studio Code </li>
</ol>

# Additional Information #
<ol>
<li> My github repository is @ <a href="#">https://github.com/dectan/FUNDAMENTALS-OF-DATA-ANALYSIS</a></li>
<li> My github Repository is called "Applied Statistic</li>
<li> This repository contains a .gitignore file, 2 *  Jupyter notebooks, and a readme file and a folder with images. </li>   
<li> My Jupyter notebooks are called "project.ipynb" and "tasks.ipynb"</li> 
<li> There are no additional files required to run program as dataset is loaded from seaborn </li>
<li> images are stored in a folder called "img" in this repository </li>
<li> Libraries that need to be imported are contained in first *text* cell of both Jupyter notebooks </li> 
</ol>

# Imported Libraries #
<ol>
<li>import numpy as np</li>
<p> NumPy is short for "Numerical Python". It allows for matematical and logical operations on arrays efficiently. NumPy also enables user to reshape,slice ,stack and join arrays.</p>
<li>import pandas as pd</li>
<p>Pandas is an open source Python library that provides high performance data manipulation tools and analysis tools. It also allows for reading and writing from various file formats, such as .csv. Pandas has functions for analyzing, cleaning , exploring and manipulating data</p>
<li>import matplotlib.pyplot as plt</li>
<p>Matplotlib is a low level graph plotting library in python. It is open source. Using Mathplotlib, different types of plots can be created, such as scatter plots, histograms,box plots etc.</p>
<li>import seaborn as sns</li>
<p>Seaborn is a Python data visualization library based on matplotlib. It provides a high-level interface for drawing attractive and informative statistical graphics.It is designed to work well with dataframes from Pandas
